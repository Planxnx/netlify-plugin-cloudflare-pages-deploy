> An awesome plugin to make you Netlify as a CI/CD tool for Cloudflare Pages

## What is this?

This is a simple plugin for Netlify to deploy your static site to Cloudflare Pages. This plugin is suitable for making CI/CD with Netlify, but hosting your static site on Cloudflare Pages.

## Why

Cause Netlify has a great Developer Experience CI/CD platform for many javascript frameworks.

- It's easy to configure.
- Widely runtimes and package manager supports.
- Multiple build environment and deployment scopes Eg. `Production`, `Deploy Previews` and `Branch deploys` (separated for each branches)
- Great build caching and build time.
- There are many ready-to-integrate plugins (and local customized plugin supports)

But Cloudflare Pages is lightning fast ‚ö°Ô∏è and has much better network latency than Netlify. Your sites will deploy on Cloudflare's edge network that's the fastest network in the world.

## How it works?

This plugin is using [Cloudflare Wrangler](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler) for under-the-hood to deploy your site to Cloudflare Pages.
It will run `$ wrangler pages deploy <PUBLISH_DIR> --project-name=<PROJECT_NAME> --branch=<BRANCH>` command after Netlify build your site.

## How to use?

### Installation

```sh
# npm
$ npm install -D netlify-plugin-cloudflare-pages-deploy

# yarn
$ yarn add -D netlify-plugin-cloudflare-pages-deploy

# pnpm
$ pnpm add -D netlify-plugin-cloudflare-pages-deploy
```

### Inputs

- `package_exec`: Package exec to use Eg. `npx`, `pnpx` or install `wrangler` to devDeps and use `npm`, `yarn` and `pnpm` instead (caching support and recommended this) Default: `npx`
- `deploy_target_branch`: Deploy target branch. For production deploy, use `production` in this config. Default: use netlify current deploy branch

### Setup

0. Prepare your Cloudflare Page project via `wrangler`

```sh
$ npx wrangler pages project create <PROJECT_NAME> --production-branch=main
```

1. Add Environment Variables to Netlify

   - `CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID`: Your target Cloudflare Account ID. See more: [Find your zone and account IDs
     ](https://developers.cloudflare.com/fundamentals/setup/find-account-and-zone-ids/)
   - `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN` : Your Cloudflare API Token (with `Pages:Edit` permission) See more: [Create a Cloudflare API token
     ](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/ci-cd/external-cicd/github-actions/#api-token)
   - `CLOUDFLARE_PAGES_PROJECT_NAME`: Your Cloudflare Pages Project Name

2. Add this plugin to your `netlify.toml`

```toml
# for all deploy contexts (production, branch deploys, Deploy Previews).

[[plugins]]
   package = "netlify-plugin-cloudflare-pages-deploy"
   [plugins.inputs]
      package_exec = "pnpx"
```

```toml
# for production deploy context. supports [`production`, `deploy-preview`, `branch-deploy`, `dev`]

[[context.production.plugins]]
	package = "netlify-plugin-cloudflare-pages-deploy"
	[context.production.plugins.inputs]
		package_exec = "pnpx"
		deploy_target_branch = "main"
```

### [Recommend]

Add `wrangler` to your project and use your lover package managers like`npm`, `yarn` or `pnpm` to run `wrangler` command instead `npx` or `pnpx`.

This will make your build faster cause Netlify always caching dependencies and `wrangler` will be cached too.

#### For `yarn` and `yarn` Workspace
```sh
$ yarn add -D wrangler
```

```toml
[[plugins]]
   package = "netlify-plugin-cloudflare-pages-deploy"
   [plugins.inputs]
      package_exec = "yarn"
```

#### For `pnpm`
```sh
$ pnpm add -D wrangler
```

```toml
[[plugins]]
   package = "netlify-plugin-cloudflare-pages-deploy"
   [plugins.inputs]
      package_exec = "pnpm exec"
```
